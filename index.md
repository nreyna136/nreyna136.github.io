### CPSC 120

Lab 1
* This was probably my favorite lab just because it introduced me to the world of coding. Although it was the simplest lab because all we did was print out words, it really made me interested in learning how to code. I felt a sense of accomplishment knowing that I was able to print out the words “hello world ”.

Lab 4
* I really enjoyed writing the code for Lab 4, part 2. It was one of the first games that we were able to write. We were supposed to write a high- or low-number guessing game using if and else statements.I really enjoyed messing with the inputs and playing the game after it was completed.

Lab 6
* In lab 6, we programmed the game Madlibs, in which we created a code that would allow us to fill in the blanks for a sentence about a sandwich. I enjoyed using arguments in this program, and I believe it was the first time I used std::vectors. This program was filled with trails and errors, but when I was able to finish it, it made me even more passionate about coding.
